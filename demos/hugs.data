  The monad type constructor @m@ is added to function results
  (modulo currying) and nowhere else.  So, for example, 

>  filter  ::              (a ->   Bool) -> [a] ->   [a]
>  filterM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m Bool) -> [a] -> m [a]

* A postfix \'@_@\' changes the result type from @(m a)@ to @(m ())@.
  Thus, for example: 

>  sequence  :: Monad m => [m a] -> m [a] 
>  sequence_ :: Monad m => [m a] -> m () 

* A prefix \'@m@\' generalizes an existing function to a monadic form.
  Thus, for example: 

>  sum  :: Num a       => [a]   -> a
>  msum :: MonadPlus m => [m a] -> m a

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Catching exceptions

-- |This is the simplest of the exception-catching functions.  It
-- takes a single argument, runs it, and if an exception is raised
-- the \"handler\" is executed, with the value of the exception passed as an
-- argument.  Otherwise, the result is returned as normal.  For example:
--
-- >   catch (openFile f ReadMode) 
-- >       (\e -> hPutStr stderr ("Couldn't open "++f++": " ++ show e))
--
-- For catching exceptions in pure (non-'IO') expressions, see the
-- function 'evaluate'.
--
-- Note that due to Haskell\'s unspecified evaluation order, an
-- expression may return one of several possible exceptions: consider
-- the expression @error \"urk\" + 1 \`div\` 0@.  Does
-- 'catch' execute the handler passing
-- @ErrorCall \"urk\"@, or @ArithError DivideByZero@?
--
-- The answer is \"either\": 'catch' makes a
-- non-deterministic choice about which exception to catch.  If you
-- call it again, you might get a different exception back.  This is
-- ok, because 'catch' is an 'IO' computation.
--
-- Note that 'catch' catches all types of exceptions, and is generally
-- used for \"cleaning up\" before passing on the exception using
-- 'throwIO'.  It is not good practice to discard the exception and
-- continue, without first checking the type of the exception (it
-- might be a 'ThreadKilled', for example).  In this case it is usually better
-- to use 'catchJust' and select the kinds of exceptions to catch.
--
-- Also note that the "Prelude" also exports a function called
-- 'Prelude.catch' with a similar type to 'Control.Exception.catch',
-- except that the "Prelude" version only catches the IO and user
-- families of exceptions (as required by Haskell 98).  
--
-- We recommend either hiding the "Prelude" version of 'Prelude.catch'
-- when importing "Control.Exception": 
--
-- > import Prelude hiding (catch)
--
-- or importing "Control.Exception" qualified, to avoid name-clashes:
--
-- > import qualified Control.Exception as C
--
-- and then using @C.catch@
--

catch  	:: IO a 		-- ^ The computation to run
  	-> (Exception -> IO a)	-- ^ Handler to invoke if an exception is raised
  	-> IO a			
catch =  ExceptionBase.catchException

-- | The function 'catchJust' is like 'catch', but it takes an extra
-- argument which is an /exception predicate/, a function which
-- selects which type of exceptions we\'re interested in.  There are
-- some predefined exception predicates for useful subsets of
-- exceptions: 'ioErrors', 'arithExceptions', and so on.  For example,
-- to catch just calls to the 'error' function, we could use
--
-- >   result <- catchJust errorCalls thing_to_try handler
--
-- Any other exceptions which are not matched by the predicate
-- are re-raised, and may be caught by an enclosing
-- 'catch' or 'catchJust'.
catchJust
	:: (Exception -> Maybe b) -- ^ Predicate to select exceptions
	-> IO a		 	  -- ^ Computation to run
	-> (b -> IO a)		  -- ^ Handler
	-> IO a
catchJust p a handler = catch a handler'
  where handler' e = case p e of 
			Nothing -> throw e
			Just b  -> handler b

-- | A version of 'catch' with the arguments swapped around; useful in
-- situations where the code for the handler is shorter.  For example:
--
-- >   do handle (\e -> exitWith (ExitFailure 1)) $
-- >	  ...
handle	   :: (Exception -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a
handle     =  flip catch

-- | A version of 'catchJust' with the arguments swapped around (see
-- 'handle').
handleJust :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -> (b -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a
handleJust p =  flip (catchJust p)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 'mapException'

-- | This function maps one exception into another as proposed in the
-- paper \"A semantics for imprecise exceptions\".

-- Notice that the usage of 'unsafePerformIO' is safe here.

mapException :: (Exception -> Exception) -> a -> a
mapException f v = unsafePerformIO (catch (evaluate v)
                                          (\x -> throw (f x)))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 'try' and variations.

-- | Similar to 'catch', but returns an 'Either' result which is
-- @('Right' a)@ if no exception was raised, or @('Left' e)@ if an
-- exception was raised and its value is @e@.
--
-- >  try a = catch (Right `liftM` a) (return . Left)
--
-- Note: as with 'catch', it is only polite to use this variant if you intend
-- to re-throw the exception after performing whatever cleanup is needed.
-- Otherwise, 'tryJust' is generally considered to be better.
--
-- Also note that "System.IO.Error" also exports a function called
-- 'System.IO.Error.try' with a similar type to 'Control.Exception.try',
-- except that it catches only the IO and user families of exceptions
-- (as required by the Haskell 98 @IO@ module).

try :: IO a -> IO (Either Exception a)
try a = catch (a >>= \ v -> return (Right v)) (\e -> return (Left e))

-- | A variant of 'try' that takes an exception predicate to select
-- which exceptions are caught (c.f. 'catchJust').  If the exception
-- does not match the predicate, it is re-thrown.
tryJust :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -> IO a -> IO (Either b a)
tryJust p a = do
  r <- try a
  case r of
	Right v -> return (Right v)

			Nothing -> throw e
			Just b  -> return (Left b)

-- Dynamic exceptions

-- $dynamic
--  #DynamicExceptions# Because the 'Exception' datatype is not extensible, there is an

-- (see "Data.Dynamic") which allows exception values of any type in
-- the 'Typeable' class to be thrown and caught.

-- | Raise any value as an exception, provided it is in the
-- 'Typeable' class.
throwDyn :: Typeable exception => exception -> b
throwDyn exception = throw (DynException (toDyn exception))








-- | Catch dynamic exceptions of the required type.  All other
-- exceptions are re-thrown, including dynamic exceptions of the wrong
-- type.
--
-- When using dynamic exceptions it is advisable to define a new
-- datatype to use for your exception type, to avoid possible clashes
-- with dynamic exceptions used in other libraries.
--
catchDyn :: Typeable exception => IO a -> (exception -> IO a) -> IO a
catchDyn m k = catchException m handle

-- Some Useful Functions

-- | When you want to acquire a resource, do some work with it, and
-- then release the resource, it is a good idea to use 'bracket',
-- because 'bracket' will install the necessary exception handler to
-- release the resource in the event that an exception is raised
-- during the computation.  If an exception is raised, then 'bracket' will 
-- re-raise the exception (after performing the release).
--
-- A common example is opening a file:
--
-- > bracket
-- >   (openFile "filename" ReadMode)
-- >   (hClose)
-- >   (\handle -> do { ... })
--
-- The arguments to 'bracket' are in this order so that we can partially apply 
-- it, e.g.:
--
-- > withFile name = bracket (openFile name) hClose
--
bracket 
	:: IO a		-- ^ computation to run first (\"acquire resource\")
	-> (a -> IO b)  -- ^ computation to run last (\"release resource\")
	-> (a -> IO c)	-- ^ computation to run in-between
	-> IO c		-- returns the value from the in-between computation
bracket before after thing =
  block (do
    a <- before 
    r <- catch 
	   (unblock (thing a))
	   (\e -> do { after a; throw e })
    after a
    return r
 )
   

-- | A specialised variant of 'bracket' with just a computation to run
-- afterward.
-- 
finally :: IO a		-- ^ computation to run first
	-> IO b		-- ^ computation to run afterward (even if an exception 
			-- was raised)
	-> IO a		-- returns the value from the first computation
a `finally` sequel =
  block (do
    r <- catch 
	     (unblock a)
	     (\e -> do { sequel; throw e })
    sequel
    return r
  )

-- | A variant of 'bracket' where the return value from the first computation
-- is not required.
bracket_ :: IO a -> IO b -> IO c -> IO c
bracket_ before after thing = bracket before (const after) (const thing)

-- | Like bracket, but only performs the final action if there was an 
-- exception raised by the in-between computation.
bracketOnError
	:: IO a		-- ^ computation to run first (\"acquire resource\")
	-> (a -> IO b)  -- ^ computation to run last (\"release resource\")
	-> (a -> IO c)	-- ^ computation to run in-between
	-> IO c		-- returns the value from the in-between computation

    a <- before

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Asynchronous exceptions

{- $async

 #AsynchronousExceptions# Asynchronous exceptions are so-called because they arise due to
external influences, and can be raised at any point during execution.
'StackOverflow' and 'HeapOverflow' are two examples of
system-generated asynchronous exceptions.

The primary source of asynchronous exceptions, however, is
'throwTo':

>  throwTo :: ThreadId -> Exception -> IO ()

'throwTo' (also 'throwDynTo' and 'Control.Concurrent.killThread') allows one
running thread to raise an arbitrary exception in another thread.  The
exception is therefore asynchronous with respect to the target thread,
which could be doing anything at the time it receives the exception.
Great care should be taken with asynchronous exceptions; it is all too
easy to introduce race conditions by the over zealous use of
'throwTo'.
-}

{- $block_handler
There\'s an implied 'block' around every exception handler in a call
to one of the 'catch' family of functions.  This is because that is
what you want most of the time - it eliminates a common race condition
in starting an exception handler, because there may be no exception
handler on the stack to handle another exception if one arrives
immediately.  If asynchronous exceptions are blocked on entering the
handler, though, we have time to install a new exception handler
before being interrupted.  If this weren\'t the default, one would have
to write something like

>      block (
>           catch (unblock (...))
>                      (\e -> handler)
>      )

If you need to unblock asynchronous exceptions again in the exception
handler, just use 'unblock' as normal.

Note that 'try' and friends /do not/ have a similar default, because
there is no exception handler in this case.  If you want to use 'try'
in an asynchronous-exception-safe way, you will need to use
'block'.
-}

{- $interruptible

Some operations are /interruptible/, which means that they can receive
asynchronous exceptions even in the scope of a 'block'.  Any function
which may itself block is defined as interruptible; this includes
'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar'
(but not 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.tryTakeMVar'),
and most operations which perform
some I\/O with the outside world.  The reason for having
interruptible operations is so that we can write things like

>      block (
>         a <- takeMVar m
>         catch (unblock (...))
>               (\e -> ...)
>      )

if the 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' was not interruptible,
then this particular
combination could lead to deadlock, because the thread itself would be
blocked in a state where it can\'t receive any asynchronous exceptions.
With 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' interruptible, however, we can be
safe in the knowledge that the thread can receive exceptions right up
until the point when the 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' succeeds.
Similar arguments apply for other interruptible operations like
'System.IO.openFile'.
-}

{- $conc_intro

The concurrency extension for Haskell is described in the paper
/Concurrent Haskell/
<http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/concurrent-haskell.ps.gz>.

Concurrency is \"lightweight\", which means that both thread creation
and context switching overheads are extremely low.  Scheduling of
Haskell threads is done internally in the Haskell runtime system, and
doesn't make use of any operating system-supplied thread packages.

However, if you want to interact with a foreign library that expects your
program to use the operating system-supplied thread package, you can do so
by using 'forkOS' instead of 'forkIO'.

Haskell threads can communicate via 'MVar's, a kind of synchronised
mutable variable (see "Control.Concurrent.MVar").  Several common
concurrency abstractions can be built from 'MVar's, and these are
provided by the "Control.Concurrent" library.
In GHC, threads may also communicate via exceptions.
-}

{- $conc_scheduling

    Scheduling may be either pre-emptive or co-operative,
    depending on the implementation of Concurrent Haskell (see below
    for information related to specific compilers).  In a co-operative
    system, context switches only occur when you use one of the
    primitives defined in this module.  This means that programs such
    as:


>   main = forkIO (write 'a') >> write 'b'
>     where write c = putChar c >> write c

    will print either @aaaaaaaaaaaaaa...@ or @bbbbbbbbbbbb...@,
    instead of some random interleaving of @a@s and @b@s.  In
    practice, cooperative multitasking is sufficient for writing
    simple graphical user interfaces.  
-}

{- $blocking
Calling a foreign C procedure (such as @getchar@) that blocks waiting
for input will block /all/ threads, unless the @threadsafe@ attribute
is used on the foreign call (and your compiler \/ operating system
supports it).  GHC's I\/O system uses non-blocking I\/O internally to
implement thread-friendly I\/O, so calling standard Haskell I\/O
functions blocks only the thread making the call.
-}

{- $osthreads

      #osthreads# In GHC, threads created by 'forkIO' are lightweight threads, and
      are managed entirely by the GHC runtime.  Typically Haskell
      threads are an order of magnitude or two more efficient (in
      terms of both time and space) than operating system threads.

      The downside of having lightweight threads is that only one can
      run at a time, so if one thread blocks in a foreign call, for
      example, the other threads cannot continue.  The GHC runtime
      works around this by making use of full OS threads where
      necessary.  When the program is built with the @-threaded@
      option (to link against the multithreaded version of the
      runtime), a thread making a @safe@ foreign call will not block
      the other threads in the system; another OS thread will take
      over running Haskell threads until the original call returns.
      The runtime maintains a pool of these /worker/ threads so that
      multiple Haskell threads can be involved in external calls
      simultaneously.

      The "System.IO" library manages multiplexing in its own way.  On
      Windows systems it uses @safe@ foreign calls to ensure that
      threads doing I\/O operations don't block the whole runtime,
      whereas on Unix systems all the currently blocked I\/O reqwests
      are managed by a single thread (the /IO manager thread/) using
      @select@.

      The runtime will run a Haskell thread using any of the available
      worker OS threads.  If you need control over which particular OS
      thread is used to run a given Haskell thread, perhaps because
      you need to call a foreign library that uses OS-thread-local
      state, then you need "bound threads" (see above).

      If you don't use the @-threaded@ option, then the runtime does
      not make use of multiple OS threads.  Foreign calls will block
      all other running Haskell threads until the call returns.  The
      "System.IO" library still does multiplexing, so there can be multiple
      threads doing I\/O, and this is handled internally by the runtime using
      @select@.
-}

{- $termination

      In a standalone GHC program, only the main thread is
      required to terminate in order for the process to terminate.
      Thus all other forked threads will simply terminate at the same
      time as the main thread (the terminology for this kind of
      behaviour is \"daemonic threads\").

      If you want the program to wait for child threads to
      finish before exiting, you need to program this yourself.  A
      simple mechanism is to have each child thread write to an
      'MVar' when it completes, and have the main
      thread wait on all the 'MVar's before
      exiting:

>   myForkIO :: IO () -> IO (MVar ())
>   myForkIO io = do
>     mvar <- newEmptyMVar
>     forkIO (io `finally` putMVar mvar ())
>     return mvar

      Note that we use 'finally' from the
      "Control.Exception" module to make sure that the
      'MVar' is written to even if the thread dies or
      is killed for some reason.

      A better method is to keep a global list of all child
      threads which we should wait for at the end of the program:

>    children :: MVar [MVar ()]
>    children = unsafePerformIO (newMVar [])
>    
>    waitForChildren :: IO ()
>    waitForChildren = do
>      cs <- takeMVar children
>      case cs of
>        []   -> return ()
>        m:ms -> do
>    	    putMVar children ms
>    	    takeMVar m
>    	    waitForChildren
>    
>    forkChild :: IO () -> IO ()
>    forkChild io = do
>    	 mvar <- newEmptyMVar
>    	 childs <- takeMVar children
>    	 putMVar children (mvar:childs)
>    	 forkIO (io `finally` putMVar mvar ())
>
>     main =
>     	later waitForChildren $
>     	...

      The main thread principle also applies to calls to Haskell from
      outside, using @foreign export@.  When the @foreign export@ed
      function is invoked, it starts a new main thread, and it returns
      when this main thread terminates.  If the call causes new
      threads to be forked, they may remain in the system after the
      @foreign export@ed function has returned.
-}

{- $preemption

      GHC implements pre-emptive multitasking: the execution of
      threads are interleaved in a random fashion.  More specifically,
      a thread may be pre-empted whenever it allocates some memory,
      which unfortunately means that tight loops which do no
      allocation tend to lock out other threads (this only seems to
      happen with pathological benchmark-style code, however).

      The rescheduling timer runs on a 20ms granularity by
      default, but this may be altered using the
      @-i\<n\>@ RTS option.  After a rescheduling
      \"tick\" the running thread is pre-empted as soon as
      possible.

      One final note: the
      @aaaa@ @bbbb@ example may not
      work too well on GHC (see Scheduling, above), due
      to the locking on a 'System.IO.Handle'.  Only one thread
      may hold the lock on a 'System.IO.Handle' at any one
      time, so if a reschedule happens while a thread is holding the
      lock, the other thread won't be able to run.  The upshot is that
      the switch from @aaaa@ to
      @bbbbb@ happens infrequently.  It can be
      improved by lowering the reschedule tick period.  We also have a
      patch that causes a reschedule whenever a thread waiting on a
      lock is woken up, but haven't found it to be useful for anything
      other than this example :-)

The member functions of this class facilitate writing values of
primitive types to raw memory (which may have been allocated with the
above mentioned routines) and reading values from blocks of raw
memory.  The class, furthermore, includes support for computing the
storage requirements and alignment restrictions of storable types.

Memory addresses are represented as values of type @'Ptr' a@, for some
@a@ which is an instance of class 'Storable'.  The type argument to
'Ptr' helps provide some valuable type safety in FFI code (you can\'t
mix pointers of different types without an explicit cast), while
helping the Haskell type system figure out which marshalling method is
needed for a given pointer.

All marshalling between Haskell and a foreign language ultimately
boils down to translating Haskell data structures into the binary
representation of a corresponding data structure of the foreign
language and vice versa.  To code this marshalling in Haskell, it is
necessary to manipulate primitive data types stored in unstructured
memory blocks.  The class 'Storable' facilitates this manipulation on
all types for which it is instantiated, which are the standard basic
types of Haskell, the fixed size @Int@ types ('Int8', 'Int16',
'Int32', 'Int64'), the fixed size @Word@ types ('Word8', 'Word16',
'Word32', 'Word64'), 'StablePtr', all types from "Foreign.C.Types",
as well as 'Ptr'.

Minimal complete definition: 'sizeOf', 'alignment', one of 'peek',
'peekElemOff' and 'peekByteOff', and one of 'poke', 'pokeElemOff' and
'pokeByteOff'.

class Storable a where

   sizeOf      :: a -> Int
   -- ^ Computes the storage requirements (in bytes) of the argument.
   -- The value of the argument is not used.

   alignment   :: a -> Int
   -- ^ Computes the alignment constraint of the argument.  An
   -- alignment constraint @x@ is fulfilled by any address divisible
   -- by @x@.  The value of the argument is not used.

   peekElemOff :: Ptr a -> Int      -> IO a
   -- ^       Read a value from a memory area regarded as an array
   --         of values of the same kind.  The first argument specifies
   --         the start address of the array and the second the index into
   --         the array (the first element of the array has index
   --         @0@).  The following equality holds,
   -- 
   -- > peekElemOff addr idx = IOExts.fixIO $ \result ->
   -- >   peek (addr `plusPtr` (idx * sizeOf result))
   --
   --         Note that this is only a specification, not
   --         necessarily the concrete implementation of the
   --         function.

   pokeElemOff :: Ptr a -> Int -> a -> IO ()
   -- ^       Write a value to a memory area regarded as an array of
   --         values of the same kind.  The following equality holds:
   -- 
   -- > pokeElemOff addr idx x = 
   -- >   poke (addr `plusPtr` (idx * sizeOf x)) x

   peekByteOff :: Ptr b -> Int      -> IO a
   -- ^       Read a value from a memory location given by a base
   --         address and offset.  The following equality holds:
   --
   -- > peekByteOff addr off = peek (addr `plusPtr` off)

   pokeByteOff :: Ptr b -> Int -> a -> IO ()
   -- ^       Write a value to a memory location given by a base
   --         address and offset.  The following equality holds:
   --
   -- > pokeByteOff addr off x = poke (addr `plusPtr` off) x
  
   peek        :: Ptr a      -> IO a
   -- ^ Read a value from the given memory location.
   --
   --  Note that the peek and poke functions might require properly
   --  aligned addresses to function correctly.  This is architecture
   --  dependent; thus, portable code should ensure that when peeking or
   --  poking values of some type @a@, the alignment
   --  constraint for @a@, as given by the function
   --  'alignment' is fulfilled.

   poke        :: Ptr a -> a -> IO ()
   -- ^ Write the given value to the given memory location.  Alignment
   -- restrictions might apply; see 'peek'.

newForeignPtr :: FinalizerPtr a -> Ptr a -> IO (ForeignPtr a)
-- ^Turns a plain memory reference into a foreign pointer, and
-- associates a finaliser with the reference.  The finaliser will be executed
-- after the last reference to the foreign object is dropped.  Note that there
-- is no guarantee on how soon the finaliser is executed after the last
-- reference was dropped; this depends on the details of the Haskell storage
-- manager. The only guarantee is that the finaliser runs before the program

withForeignPtr :: ForeignPtr a -> (Ptr a -> IO b) -> IO b
-- ^This is a way to look at the pointer living inside a
-- foreign object.  This function takes a function which is
-- applied to that pointer. The resulting 'IO' action is then
-- executed. The foreign object is kept alive at least during
-- the whole action, even if it is not used directly
-- inside. Note that it is not safe to return the pointer from
-- the action and use it after the action completes. All uses
-- of the pointer should be inside the
-- 'withForeignPtr' bracket.  The reason for
-- this unsafeness is the same as for
-- 'unsafeForeignPtrToPtr' below: the finalizer
-- may run earlier than expected, because the compiler can only
-- track usage of the 'ForeignPtr' object, not
-- a 'Ptr' object made from it.
--
-- This function is normally used for marshalling data to
-- or from the object pointed to by the
-- 'ForeignPtr', using the operations from the
-- 'Storable' class.

-- combined allocation and marshalling
-- -----------------------------------

-- |Allocate a block of memory and marshal a value into it
-- (the combination of 'malloc' and 'poke').
-- The size of the area allocated is determined by the 'Foreign.Storable.sizeOf'
-- method from the instance of 'Storable' for the appropriate type.
--
-- The memory may be deallocated using 'Foreign.Marshal.Alloc.free' or
-- 'Foreign.Marshal.Alloc.finalizerFree' when no longer required.

-- a pointer to a temporarily allocated block of memory into which
-- @val@ has been marshalled (the combination of 'alloca' and 'poke').
--
-- The memory is freed when @f@ terminates (either normally or via an
-- exception), so the pointer passed to @f@ must /not/ be used after this.
--

-- -------------------------------------

-- |Replicates a @withXXX@ combinator over a list of objects, yielding a list of
-- marshalled objects
--

-- C99 types which are still missing include:

{- $ctypes

These types are needed to accurately represent C function prototypes,
in order to access C library interfaces in Haskell.  The Haskell system
is not required to represent those types exactly as C does, but the
following guarantees are provided concerning a Haskell type @CT@
representing a C type @t@:

* If a C function prototype has @t@ as an argument or result type, the
  use of @CT@ in the corresponding position in a foreign declaration
  permits the Haskell program to access the full range of values encoded
  by the C type; and conversely, any Haskell value for @CT@ has a valid
  representation in C.

* @'sizeOf' ('Prelude.undefined' :: CT)@ will yield the same value as
  @sizeof (t)@ in C.

* @'alignment' ('Prelude.undefined' :: CT)@ matches the alignment
  constraint enforced by the C implementation for @t@.

* The members 'peek' and 'poke' of the 'Storable' class map all values
  of @CT@ to the corresponding value of @t@ and vice versa.

* When an instance of 'Prelude.Bounded' is defined for @CT@, the values
  of 'Prelude.minBound' and 'Prelude.maxBound' coincide with @t_MIN@
  and @t_MAX@ in C.

* When an instance of 'Prelude.Eq' or 'Prelude.Ord' is defined for @CT@,
  the predicates defined by the type class implement the same relation
  as the corresponding predicate in C on @t@.

* When an instance of 'Prelude.Num', 'Prelude.Read', 'Prelude.Integral',
  'Prelude.Fractional', 'Prelude.Floating', 'Prelude.RealFrac', or
  'Prelude.RealFloat' is defined for @CT@, the arithmetic operations
  defined by the type class implement the same function as the
  corresponding arithmetic operations (if available) in C on @t@.

* When an instance of 'Bits' is defined for @CT@, the bitwise operation
  defined by the type class implement the same function as the

When called, 'trace' outputs the string in its first argument, before 
returning the second argument as its result. The 'trace' function is not 
referentially transparent, and should only be used for debugging, or for 
monitoring execution. Some implementations of 'trace' may decorate the string 
that\'s output to indicate that you\'re tracing. The function is implemented on
top of 'putTraceMsg'.

Like 'trace', but uses 'show' on the argument to convert it to a 'String'.

Haskell 98 Time of Day Library
------------------------------

2000/06/17 <michael.weber@post.rwth-aachen.de>:
RESTRICTIONS:
  * min./max. time diff currently is restricted to
    [minBound::Int, maxBound::Int]

  * surely other restrictions wrt. min/max bounds


NOTES:
  * printing times

    `showTime' (used in `instance Show ClockTime') always prints time
    converted to the local timezone (even if it is taken from
    `(toClockTime . toUTCTime)'), whereas `calendarTimeToString'
    honors the tzone & tz fields and prints UTC or whatever timezone
    is stored inside CalendarTime.

    Maybe `showTime' should be changed to use UTC, since it would
    better correspond to the actual representation of `ClockTime'
    (can be done by replacing localtime(3) by gmtime(3)).


BUGS:
  * add proper handling of microsecs, currently, they're mostly
    ignored

  * `formatFOO' case of `%s' is currently broken...


TODO:
  * check for unusual date cases, like 1970/1/1 00:00h, and conversions
    between different timezone's etc.

  * check, what needs to be in the IO monad, the current situation
    seems to be a bit inconsistent to me

  * check whether `isDst = -1' works as expected on other arch's
    (Solaris anyone?)

  * add functions to parse strings to `CalendarTime' (some day...)

  * implement padding capabilities ("%_", "%-") in `formatFOO'

  * add rfc822 timezone (+0200 is CEST) representation ("%z") in `formatFOO'

{- $intro

This library deals with the common task of pseudo-random
number generation. The library makes it possible to generate
repeatable results, by starting with a specified initial random
number generator; or to get different results on each run by using the 
system-initialised generator, or by supplying a seed from some other
source.

The library is split into two layers: 

* A core /random number generator/ provides a supply of bits. The class
'RandomGen' provides a common interface to such generators.

* The class 'Random' provides a way to extract particular values from
a random number generator. For example, the 'Float' instance of 'Random'
allows one to generate random values of type 'Float'.

This implementation uses the Portable Combined Generator of L'Ecuyer
["System.Random\#LEcuyer"] for 32-bit computers, transliterated by
Lennart Augustsson.  It has a period of roughly 2.30584e18.

-}

-- | The class 'RandomGen' provides a common interface to random number
-- generators.

class RandomGen g where

   -- |The 'next' operation returns an 'Int' that is uniformly distributed
   -- in the range returned by 'genRange' (including both end points),
   -- and a new generator.
   next     :: g -> (Int, g)

   -- |The 'split' operation allows one to obtain two distinct random number
   -- generators. This is very useful in functional programs (for example, when
   -- passing a random number generator down to recursive calls), but very
   -- little work has been done on statistically robust implementations of
   -- 'split' (["System.Random\#Burton", "System.Random\#Hellekalek"]
   -- are the only examples we know of).
   split    :: g -> (g, g)

   -- |The 'genRange' operation yields the range of values returned by
   -- the generator.
   --
   -- It is required that:
   --
   -- * If @(a,b) = 'genRange' g@, then @a < b@.
   --
   -- * 'genRange' is not strict.
   --
   -- The second condition ensures that 'genRange' cannot examine its
   -- argument, and hence the value it returns can be determined only by the
   -- instance of 'RandomGen'.  That in turn allows an implementation to make
   -- a single call to 'genRange' to establish a generator's range, without
   -- being concerned that the generator returned by (say) 'next' might have
   -- a different range to the generator passed to 'next'.
   genRange :: g -> (Int,Int)

   -- default method
   genRange g = (minBound,maxBound)

{- |The "System.Random" library provides one instance of 'RandomGen', the
abstract data type 'StdGen'.

The 'StdGen' instance of 'RandomGen' has a 'genRange' of at least 30 bits.

The result of repeatedly using 'next' should be at least as statistically
robust as the /Minimal Standard Random Number Generator/ described by
["System.Random\#Park", "System.Random\#Carta"].
Until more is known about implementations of 'split', all we require is
that 'split' deliver generators that are (a) not identical and
(b) independently robust in the sense just given.

The 'Show' and 'Read' instances of 'StdGen' provide a primitive way to save the
state of a random number generator.
It is required that @'read' ('show' g) == g@.

In addition, 'read' may be used to map an arbitrary string (not necessarily one
produced by 'show') onto a value of type 'StdGen'. In general, the 'read'
instance of 'StdGen' has the following properties: 

* It guarantees to succeed on any string. 

* It guarantees to consume only a finite portion of the string. 

* Different argument strings are likely to result in different results.

{- NOTES:

It's tempting to try to remove the target file before opening it for
writing.  This could be useful: for example if the target file is an
executable that is in use, writing will fail, but unlinking first
would succeed.

However, it certainly isn't always what you want.

 * if the target file is hardlinked, removing it would break
   the hard link, but just opening would preserve it.

 * opening and truncating will preserve permissions and
   ACLs on the target.

 * If the destination file is read-only in a writable directory,
   we might want copyFile to fail.  Removing the target first
   would succeed, however.

 * If the destination file is special (eg. /dev/null), removing
   it is probably not the right thing.  Copying to /dev/null
   should leave /dev/null intact, not replace it with a plain
   file.

 * There's a small race condition between removing the target and
   opening it for writing during which time someone might
   create it again.

Sven Panne <Sven.Panne@informatik.uni-muenchen.de> Oct. 1996 (small
changes Dec. 1997)

Two rather obscure features are missing: The Bash 2.0 non-option hack
(if you don't already know it, you probably don't want to hear about
it...) and the recognition of long options with a single dash
(e.g. '-help' is recognised as '--help', as long as there is no short
option 'h').

Other differences between GNU's getopt and this implementation:

* To enforce a coherent description of options and arguments, there
  are explanation fields in the option/argument descriptor.

* Error messages are now more informative, but no longer POSIX
  compliant... :-(

And a final Haskell advertisement: The GNU C implementation uses well
over 1100 lines, we need only 195 here, including a 46 line example!

--
-- In general terms, a weak pointer is a reference to an object that is
-- not followed by the garbage collector - that is, the existence of a
-- weak pointer to an object has no effect on the lifetime of that
-- object.  A weak pointer can be de-referenced to find out
-- whether the object it refers to is still alive or not, and if so
-- to return the object itself.
-- 
-- Weak pointers are particularly useful for caches and memo tables.
-- To build a memo table, you build a data structure 
-- mapping from the function argument (the key) to its result (the
-- value).  When you apply the function to a new argument you first
-- check whether the key\/value pair is already in the memo table.
-- The key point is that the memo table itself should not keep the
-- key and value alive.  So the table should contain a weak pointer
-- to the key, not an ordinary pointer.  The pointer to the value must
-- not be weak, because the only reference to the value might indeed be
-- from the memo table.   
-- 
-- So it looks as if the memo table will keep all its values
-- alive for ever.  One way to solve this is to purge the table
-- occasionally, by deleting entries whose keys have died.
-- 
-- The weak pointers in this library
-- support another approach, called /finalization/.
-- When the key referred to by a weak pointer dies, the storage manager
-- arranges to run a programmer-specified finalizer.  In the case of memo
-- tables, for example, the finalizer could remove the key\/value pair
-- from the memo table.  
-- 
-- Another difficulty with the memo table is that the value of a
-- key\/value pair might itself contain a pointer to the key.
-- So the memo table keeps the value alive, which keeps the key alive,
-- even though there may be no other references to the key so both should
-- die.  The weak pointers in this library provide a slight 
-- generalisation of the basic weak-pointer idea, in which each
-- weak pointer actually contains both a key and a value.

  A specialised version of 'mkWeakPtr', where the 'Weak' object
  returned is simply thrown away (however the finalizer will be
  remembered by the garbage collector, and will still be run
  when the key becomes unreachable).

  Note: adding a finalizer to a 'Foreign.ForeignPtr.ForeignPtr' using
  'addFinalizer' won't work as well as using the specialised version
  'Foreign.ForeignPtr.addForeignPtrFinalizer' because the latter
  version adds the finalizer to the primitive 'ForeignPtr#' object
  inside, whereas the generic 'addFinalizer' will add the finalizer to
  the box.  Optimisations tend to remove the box, which may cause the
  finalizer to run earlier than you intended.  The same motivation
  justifies the existence of
  'Control.Concurrent.MVar.addMVarFinalizer' and
  'Data.IORef.mkWeakIORef' (the non-uniformity is accidental).

{- $precise

The above informal specification is fine for simple situations, but
matters can get complicated.  In particular, it needs to be clear
exactly when a key dies, so that any weak pointers that refer to it
can be finalized.  Suppose, for example, the value of one weak pointer
refers to the key of another...does that keep the key alive?

The behaviour is simply this:

 *  If a weak pointer (object) refers to an /unreachable/
    key, it may be finalized.

 *  Finalization means (a) arrange that subsequent calls
    to 'deRefWeak' return 'Nothing'; and (b) run the finalizer.

This behaviour depends on what it means for a key to be reachable.
Informally, something is reachable if it can be reached by following
ordinary pointers from the root set, but not following weak pointers.
We define reachability more precisely as follows A heap object is
reachable if:

 * It is a member of the /root set/.

 * It is directly pointed to by a reachable object, other than
   a weak pointer object.

 * It is a weak pointer object whose key is reachable.

 * It is the value or finalizer of an object whose key is reachable.

  Utility functions that maintain the balance properties of the tree.
  All constructors assume that all values in [l] < [k] and all values
  in [r] > [k], and that [l] and [r] are valid trees.
  
  In order of sophistication:
    [Bin sz k x l r]  The type constructor.
    [bin k x l r]     Maintains the correct size, assumes that both [l]
                      and [r] are balanced with respect to each other.
    [balance k x l r] Restores the balance and size.
                      Assumes that the original tree was balanced and
                      that [l] or [r] has changed by at most one element.
    [join k x l r]    Restores balance and size. 

  Furthermore, we can construct a new tree from two trees. Both operations
  assume that all values in [l] < all values in [r] and that [l] and [r]
  are valid:
    [glue l r]        Glues [l] and [r] together. Assumes that [l] and
                      [r] are already balanced with respect to each other.
    [merge l r]       Merges two trees and restores balance.

  Note: in contrast to Adam's paper, we use (<=) comparisons instead
  of (<) comparisons in [join], [merge] and [balance]. 
  Quickcheck (on [difference]) showed that this was necessary in order 
  to maintain the invariants. It is quite unsatisfactory that I haven't 
  been able to find out why this is actually the case! Fortunately, it 
  doesn't hurt to be a bit more conservative.

  [balance l x r] balances two trees with value x.
  The sizes of the trees should balance after decreasing the
  size of one of them. (a rotation).

  [delta] is the maximal relative difference between the sizes of
          two trees, it corresponds with the [w] in Adams' paper.
  [ratio] is the ratio between an outer and inner sibling of the
          heavier subtree in an unbalanced setting. It determines
          whether a double or single rotation should be performed
          to restore balance. It is correspondes with the inverse
          of $\alpha$ in Adam's article.

  Note that:
  - [delta] should be larger than 4.646 with a [ratio] of 2.
  - [delta] should be larger than 3.745 with a [ratio] of 1.534.
  
  - A lower [delta] leads to a more 'perfectly' balanced tree.
  - A higher [delta] performs less rebalancing.

  - Balancing is automatic for random data and a balancing
    scheme is only necessary to avoid pathological worst cases.
    Almost any choice will do, and in practice, a rather large
    [delta] may perform better than smaller one.

  Note: in contrast to Adam's paper, we use a ratio of (at least) [2]
  to decide whether a single or double rotation is needed. Allthough
  he actually proves that this ratio is needed to maintain the
  invariants, his implementation uses an invalid ratio of [1].

* All arithmetic is performed modulo 2^n, where n is the number of
  bits in the type.  One non-obvious consequence of this is that 'Prelude.negate'
  should /not/ raise an error on negative arguments.

* For coercing between any two integer types, use
  'Prelude.fromIntegral', which is specialized for all the
  common cases so should be fast enough.  Coercing word types to and
  from integer types preserves representation, not sign.

* It would be very natural to add a type @Natural@ providing an unbounded 
  size unsigned integer, just as 'Prelude.Integer' provides unbounded
  size signed integers.  We do not do that yet since there is no demand
  for it.

* The rules that hold for 'Prelude.Enum' instances over a bounded type
  such as 'Prelude.Int' (see the section of the Haskell report dealing
  with arithmetic sequences) also hold for the 'Prelude.Enum' instances
  over the various 'Word' types defined here.

* Right and left shifts by amounts greater than or equal to the width
  of the type result in a zero result.  This is contrary to the
  behaviour in C, which is undefined; a common interpretation is to
  truncate the shift count to the width of the type, for example @1 \<\<
  32 == 1@ in some C implementations.

-- The 'Typeable' class reifies types to some extent by associating type
-- representations to types. These type representations can be compared,
-- and one can in turn define a type-safe cast operation. To this end,
-- an unsafe cast is guarded by a test for type (representation)
-- equivalence. The module "Data.Dynamic" uses Typeable for an
-- implementation of dynamics. The module "Data.Generics" uses Typeable
-- and type-safe cast (but not dynamics) to support the \"Scrap your
-- boilerplate\" style of generic programming.

----------------- Construction --------------------

-- | Applies a type constructor to a sequence of types
mkTyConApp  :: TyCon -> [TypeRep] -> TypeRep
mkTyConApp tc@(TyCon tc_k _) args 
  = TypeRep (appKeys tc_k arg_ks) tc args
  where
    arg_ks = [k | TypeRep k _ _ <- args]

-- | A special case of 'mkTyConApp', which applies the function 
-- type constructor to a pair of types.
mkFunTy  :: TypeRep -> TypeRep -> TypeRep
mkFunTy f a = mkTyConApp funTc [f,a]

-- | Splits a type constructor application
splitTyConApp :: TypeRep -> (TyCon,[TypeRep])
splitTyConApp (TypeRep _ tc trs) = (tc,trs)

-- | Applies a type to a function type.  Returns: @'Just' u@ if the
-- first argument represents a function of type @t -> u@ and the
-- second argument represents a function of type @t@.  Otherwise,
-- returns 'Nothing'.
funResultTy :: TypeRep -> TypeRep -> Maybe TypeRep
funResultTy trFun trArg
  = case splitTyConApp trFun of
      (tc, [t1,t2]) | tc == funTc && t1 == trArg -> Just t2
      _ -> Nothing

-- | Adds a TypeRep argument to a TypeRep.
mkAppTy :: TypeRep -> TypeRep -> TypeRep
mkAppTy (TypeRep tr_k tc trs) arg_tr
  = let (TypeRep arg_k _ _) = arg_tr
     in  TypeRep (appKey tr_k arg_k) tc (trs++[arg_tr])

-- If we enforce the restriction that there is only one
-- @TyCon@ for a type & it is shared among all its uses,
-- we can map them onto Ints very simply. The benefit is,
-- of course, that @TyCon@s can then be compared efficiently.

-- Provided the implementor of other @Typeable@ instances
-- takes care of making all the @TyCon@s CAFs (toplevel constants),
-- this will work. 

-- If this constraint does turn out to be a sore thumb, changing
-- the Eq instance for TyCons is trivial.

-- | Builds a 'TyCon' object representing a type constructor.  An
-- implementation of "Data.Typeable" should ensure that the following holds:
--
-- >  mkTyCon "a" == mkTyCon "a"
--

mkTyCon :: String	-- ^ the name of the type constructor (should be unique
			-- in the program, so it might be wise to use the
			-- fully qualified name).
	-> TyCon	-- ^ A unique 'TyCon' object
mkTyCon str = TyCon (mkTyConKey str) str

-- General purpose finite sequences.
-- Apart from being finite and having strict operations, sequences
-- also differ from lists in supporting a wider variety of operations
-- efficiently.
--
-- An amortized running time is given for each operation, with /n/ referring
-- to the length of the sequence and /i/ being the integral index used by
-- some operations.  These bounds hold even in a persistent (shared) setting.
--
-- The implementation uses 2-3 finger trees annotated with sizes,
-- as described in section 4.2 of
--
--    * Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson,
--	\"Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure\",

--	<http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html>
--
-- /Note/: Many of these operations have the same names as similar
-- operations on lists in the "Prelude".  The ambiguity may be resolved
-- using either qualification or the @hiding@ clause.

--
-- This implementation of hash tables uses the low-order /n/ bits of the hash
-- value for a key, where /n/ varies as the hash table grows.  A good hash
-- function therefore will give an even distribution regardless of /n/.
--
-- If your keyspace is integrals such that the low-order bits between
-- keys are highly variable, then you could get away with using 'id'
-- as the hash function.
--
-- We provide some sample hash functions for 'Int' and 'String' below.

golden :: Int32

-- | A sample (and useful) hash function for Int and Int32,
-- implemented by extracting the uppermost 32 bits of the 64-bit
-- result of multiplying by a 32-bit constant.  The constant is from
-- Knuth, derived from the golden ratio:
--
-- > golden = round ((sqrt 5 - 1) * 2^31) :: Int

-- | A sample hash function for Strings.  We keep multiplying by the
-- golden ratio and adding.  The implementation is:
--
-- > hashString = foldl' f 0
-- >   where f m c = fromIntegral (ord c) + mulHi m golden
--
-- Note that this has not been extensively tested for reasonability,

-- will minimize gaps in the hash space.

-- An efficient implementation of integer sets.

-- Since many function names (but not the type name) clash with

--
-- The implementation is based on /big-endian patricia trees/.  This data
-- structure performs especially well on binary operations like 'union'
-- and 'intersection'.  However, my benchmarks show that it is also
-- (much) faster on insertions and deletions when compared to a generic
-- size-balanced set implementation (see "Data.Set").

  Finding the highest bit (mask) in a word [x] can be done efficiently in
  three ways:
  * convert to a floating point value and the mantissa tells us the 
    [log2(x)] that corresponds with the highest bit position. The mantissa 
    is retrieved either via the standard C function [frexp] or by some bit 
    twiddling on IEEE compatible numbers (float). Note that one needs to 
    use at least [double] precision for an accurate mantissa of 32 bit 
    numbers.
  * use bit twiddling, a logarithmic sequence of bitwise or's and shifts (bit).
  * use processor specific assembler instruction (asm).

  The most portable way would be [bit], but is it efficient enough?
  I have measured the cycle counts of the different methods on an AMD 
  Athlon-XP 1800 (~ Pentium III 1.8Ghz) using the RDTSC instruction:

  highestBitMask: method  cycles
                  --------------
                   frexp   200
                   float    33
                   bit      11
                   asm      12

  highestBit:     method  cycles
                  --------------
                   frexp   195
                   float    33
                   bit      11
                   asm      11

  Wow, the bit twiddling is on today's RISC like machines even faster
  than a single CISC instruction (BSR)!
----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{----------------------------------------------------------------------
  [highestBitMask] returns a word where only the highest bit is set.
  It is found by first setting all bits in lower positions than the 
  highest bit and than taking an exclusive or with the original value.
  Allthough the function may look expensive, GHC compiles this into
  excellent C code that subsequently compiled into highly efficient
  machine code. The algorithm is derived from Jorg Arndt's FXT library.

Quicksort replaced by mergesort, 14/5/2002.

From: Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>

I am curious as to why the List.sort implementation in GHC is a
quicksort algorithm rather than an algorithm that guarantees n log n
time in the worst case? I have attached a mergesort implementation along
with a few scripts to time it's performance, the results of which are
shown below (* means it didn't finish successfully - in all cases this
was due to a stack overflow).

If I heap profile the random_list case with only 10000 then I see
random_list peaks at using about 2.5M of memory, whereas in the same
program using List.sort it uses only 100k.

-- | The 'unfoldr' function is a \`dual\' to 'foldr': while 'foldr'
-- reduces a list to a summary value, 'unfoldr' builds a list from
-- a seed value.  The function takes the element and returns 'Nothing'
-- if it is done producing the list or returns 'Just' @(a,b)@, in which
-- case, @a@ is a prepended to the list and @b@ is used as the next
-- element in a recursive call.  For example,
--
-- > iterate f == unfoldr (\x -> Just (x, f x))
--
-- In some cases, 'unfoldr' can undo a 'foldr' operation:
--
-- > unfoldr f' (foldr f z xs) == xs
--
-- if the following holds:
--
-- > f' (f x y) = Just (x,y)

-- An efficient implementation of maps from integer keys to values.
--
-- Since many function names (but not the type name) clash with
-- "Prelude" names, this module is usually imported @qualified@, e.g.
--
-- >  import Data.IntMap (IntMap)
-- >  import qualified Data.IntMap as IntMap
--
-- The implementation is based on /big-endian patricia trees/.  This data
-- structure performs especially well on binary operations like 'union'
-- and 'intersection'.  However, my benchmarks show that it is also
-- (much) faster on insertions and deletions when compared to a generic
-- size-balanced map implementation (see "Data.Map" and "Data.FiniteMap").

  Finding the highest bit (mask) in a word [x] can be done efficiently in
  three ways:
  * convert to a floating point value and the mantissa tells us the 
    [log2(x)] that corresponds with the highest bit position. The mantissa 
    is retrieved either via the standard C function [frexp] or by some bit 
    twiddling on IEEE compatible numbers (float). Note that one needs to 
    use at least [double] precision for an accurate mantissa of 32 bit 
    numbers.
  * use bit twiddling, a logarithmic sequence of bitwise or's and shifts (bit).
  * use processor specific assembler instruction (asm).

  The most portable way would be [bit], but is it efficient enough?
  I have measured the cycle counts of the different methods on an AMD 
  Athlon-XP 1800 (~ Pentium III 1.8Ghz) using the RDTSC instruction:

  highestBitMask: method  cycles
                  --------------
                   frexp   200
                   float    33
                   bit      11
                   asm      12

  highestBit:     method  cycles
                  --------------
                   frexp   195
                   float    33
                   bit      11
                   asm      11

  Wow, the bit twiddling is on today's RISC like machines even faster
  than a single CISC instruction (BSR)!
----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{----------------------------------------------------------------------
  [highestBitMask] returns a word where only the highest bit is set.
  It is found by first setting all bits in lower positions than the 
  highest bit and than taking an exclusive or with the original value.
  Allthough the function may look expensive, GHC compiles this into
  excellent C code that subsequently compiled into highly efficient
  machine code. The algorithm is derived from Jorg Arndt's FXT library.

A 'Version' represents the version of a software entity.  

An instance of 'Eq' is provided, which implements exact equality
modulo reordering of the tags in the 'versionTags' field.

An instance of 'Ord' is also provided, which gives lexicographic
ordering on the 'versionBranch' fields (i.e. 2.1 > 2.0, 1.2.3 > 1.2.2,
etc.).  This is expected to be sufficient for many uses, but note that
you may need to use a more specific ordering for your versioning
scheme.  For example, some versioning schemes may include pre-releases
which have tags @\"pre1\"@, @\"pre2\"@, and so on, and these would need to
be taken into account when determining ordering.  In some cases, date
ordering may be more appropriate, so the application would have to
look for @date@ tags in the 'versionTags' field and compare those.
The bottom line is, don't always assume that 'compare' and other 'Ord'
operations are the right thing for every 'Version'.

Similarly, concrete representations of versions may differ.  One
possible concrete representation is provided (see 'showVersion' and
'parseVersion'), but depending on the application a different concrete
representation may be more appropriate.

data Version =

		-- version 3 is 3.1, the second branch off the trunk after
		-- version 3 is 3.2, and so on.  The tree can be branched
		-- arbitrarily, just by adding more digits.
		-- 
		-- We represent the branch as a list of 'Int', so
		-- version 3.2.1 becomes [3,2,1].  Lexicographic ordering
		-- (i.e. the default instance of 'Ord' for @[Int]@) gives
		-- the natural ordering of branches.

    -- * Deriving Instances of 'Ix'
    -- | Derived instance declarations for the class 'Ix' are only possible
    -- for enumerations (i.e. datatypes having only nullary constructors)
    -- and single-constructor datatypes, including arbitrarily large tuples,
    -- whose constituent types are instances of 'Ix'. 
    -- 
    -- * For an enumeration, the nullary constructors are assumed to be
    -- numbered left-to-right with the indices being 0 to n-1 inclusive. This
    -- is the same numbering defined by the 'Enum' class. For example, given
    -- the datatype: 
    -- 
    -- >	data Colour = Red | Orange | Yellow | Green | Blue | Indigo | Violet
    -- 
    -- we would have: 
    -- 
    -- >	range   (Yellow,Blue)        ==  [Yellow,Green,Blue]
    -- >	index   (Yellow,Blue) Green  ==  1
    -- >	inRange (Yellow,Blue) Red    ==  False
    -- 
    -- * For single-constructor datatypes, the derived instance declarations
    -- are as shown for tuples in Figure 1
    -- <http://www.haskell.org/onlinelibrary/ix.html#prelude-index>.

  Utility functions that maintain the balance properties of the tree.
  All constructors assume that all values in [l] < [x] and all values
  in [r] > [x], and that [l] and [r] are valid trees.
  
  In order of sophistication:
    [Bin sz x l r]    The type constructor.
    [bin x l r]       Maintains the correct size, assumes that both [l]
                      and [r] are balanced with respect to each other.
    [balance x l r]   Restores the balance and size.
                      Assumes that the original tree was balanced and
                      that [l] or [r] has changed by at most one element.
    [join x l r]      Restores balance and size. 

  Furthermore, we can construct a new tree from two trees. Both operations
  assume that all values in [l] < all values in [r] and that [l] and [r]
  are valid:
    [glue l r]        Glues [l] and [r] together. Assumes that [l] and

    [merge l r]       Merges two trees and restores balance.

  Note: in contrast to Adam's paper, we use (<=) comparisons instead
  of (<) comparisons in [join], [merge] and [balance]. 
  Quickcheck (on [difference]) showed that this was necessary in order 
  to maintain the invariants. It is quite unsatisfactory that I haven't 
  been able to find out why this is actually the case! Fortunately, it 
  doesn't hurt to be a bit more conservative.

{--------------------------------------------------------------------
  [balance x l r] balances two trees with value x.
  The sizes of the trees should balance after decreasing the
  size of one of them. (a rotation).

  [delta] is the maximal relative difference between the sizes of
          two trees, it corresponds with the [w] in Adams' paper,
          or equivalently, [1/delta] corresponds with the $\alpha$
          in Nievergelt's paper. Adams shows that [delta] should
          be larger than 3.745 in order to garantee that the
          rotations can always restore balance.         

  [ratio] is the ratio between an outer and inner sibling of the
          heavier subtree in an unbalanced setting. It determines
          whether a double or single rotation should be performed
          to restore balance. It is correspondes with the inverse
          of $\alpha$ in Adam's article.

  Note that:
  - [delta] should be larger than 4.646 with a [ratio] of 2.
  - [delta] should be larger than 3.745 with a [ratio] of 1.534.
  
  - A lower [delta] leads to a more 'perfectly' balanced tree.
  - A higher [delta] performs less rebalancing.

  - Balancing is automatic for random data and a balancing
    scheme is only necessary to avoid pathological worst cases.
    Almost any choice will do in practice
    
  - Allthough it seems that a rather large [delta] may perform better 
    than smaller one, measurements have shown that the smallest [delta]
    of 4 is actually the fastest on a wide range of operations. It
    especially improves performance on worst-case scenarios like
    a sequence of ordered insertions.

  Note: in contrast to Adams' paper, we use a ratio of (at least) 2
  to decide whether a single or double rotation is needed. Allthough
  he actually proves that this ratio is needed to maintain the
  invariants, his implementation uses a (invalid) ratio of 1. 
  He is aware of the problem though since he has put a comment in his 
  original source code that he doesn't care about generating a 
  slightly inbalanced tree since it doesn't seem to matter in practice. 
  However (since we use quickcheck :-) we will stick to strictly balanced 
  trees.

{- $intro
Haskell provides indexable /arrays/, which may be thought of as functions
whose domains are isomorphic to contiguous subsets of the integers.
Functions restricted in this way can be implemented efficiently;
in particular, a programmer may reasonably expect rapid access to
the components.  To ensure the possibility of such an implementation,
arrays are treated as data, not as general functions.

Since most array functions involve the class 'Ix', this module is exported
from "Data.Array" so that modules need not import both "Data.Array" and
"Data.Ix".

{- $notes

* All arithmetic is performed modulo 2^n, where @n@ is the number of
  bits in the type.

* For coercing between any two integer types, use 'Prelude.fromIntegral',
  which is specialized for all the common cases so should be fast
  enough.  Coercing word types (see "Data.Word") to and from integer
  types preserves representation, not sign.

* The rules that hold for 'Prelude.Enum' instances over a
  bounded type such as 'Int' (see the section of the
  Haskell report dealing with arithmetic sequences) also hold for the
  'Prelude.Enum' instances over the various
  'Int' types defined here.

* Right and left shifts by amounts greater than or equal to the width
  of the type result in either zero or -1, depending on the sign of
  the value being shifted.  This is contrary to the behaviour in C,
  which is undefined; a common interpretation is to truncate the shift
  count to the width of the type, for example @1 \<\< 32
  == 1@ in some C implementations.

{-

Alternate experimental formulation of loopU which partitions it into
an allocating wrapper and an imperitive array-mutating loop.

The point in doing this split is that we might be able to fuse multiple
loops into a single wrapper. This would save reallocating another buffer.
It should also give better cache locality by reusing the buffer.

Note that this stuff needs ghc-6.5 from May 26 or later for the RULES to
really work reliably.

heirarchy:

each is a special case of the things above

so we get rules that combine things on the same level

so all the cases:

down/down     --> down   fuseAccAccEFL
noAcc/noAcc   --> noAcc  fuseNoAccNoAccEFL

noAcc/down    --> down   fuseNoAccAccEFL

and if we do the map, filter special cases then it adds a load more:

map/map       --> map    fuseMapMapEFL
filter/filter --> filter fuseFilterFilterEFL

map/filter    --> noAcc  fuseMapFilterEFL

-- | A time and space-efficient implementation of lazy byte vectors
-- using lists of packed 'Word8' arrays, suitable for high performance
-- use, both in terms of large data quantities, or high speed
-- requirements. Byte vectors are encoded as lazy lists of strict 'Word8'
-- arrays of bytes. They provide a means to manipulate large byte vectors
-- without requiring the entire vector be resident in memory.
--
-- Some operations, such as concat, append, reverse and cons, have
-- better complexity than their "Data.ByteString" equivalents, due to
-- optimisations resulting from the list spine structure. And for other
-- operations Lazy ByteStrings are usually within a few percent of
-- strict ones, but with better heap usage. For data larger than the
-- available memory, or if you have tight memory constraints, this
-- module will be the only option. The default chunk size is 64k, which
-- should be good in most circumstances. For people with large L2
-- caches, you may want to increase this to fit your cache.
--
-- This module is intended to be imported @qualified@, to avoid name
-- clashes with "Prelude" functions.  eg.

-- | /O(n)/ 'replicate' @n x@ is a ByteString of length @n@ with @x@
-- the value of every element. The following holds:

replicate w = B.replicate w . c2w

-- | /O(n)/, where /n/ is the length of the result.  The 'unfoldr' 
-- function is analogous to the List \'unfoldr\'.  'unfoldr' builds a 
-- ByteString from a seed value.  The function takes the element and 
-- returns 'Nothing' if it is done producing the ByteString or returns 
-- 'Just' @(a,b)@, in which case, @a@ is the next character in the string, 
-- and @b@ is the seed value for further production.
--
-- Examples:
--
-- > unfoldr (\x -> if x <= '9' then Just (x, succ x) else Nothing) '0' == "0123456789"
unfoldr :: (a -> Maybe (Char, a)) -> a -> ByteString

-- value.  However, the length of the result is limited by the first
-- argument to 'unfoldrN'.  This function is more efficient than 'unfoldr'
-- when the maximum length of the result is known.
--
-- The following equation relates 'unfoldrN' and 'unfoldr':
--
-- > unfoldrN n f s == take n (unfoldr f s)

    -- When the '//' operator is applied to a diff array, its contents
    -- are physically updated in place. The old array silently changes
    -- its representation without changing the visible behavior:
    -- it stores a link to the new current array along with the
    -- difference to be applied to get the old contents.
    --
    -- So if a diff array is used in a single-threaded style,
    -- i.e. after '//' application the old version is no longer used,
    -- @a'!'i@ takes O(1) time and @a '//' d@ takes O(@length d@).
    -- Accessing elements of older versions gradually becomes slower.
    --
    -- Updating an array which is not current makes a physical copy.
    -- The resulting array is unlinked from the old family. So you
    -- can obtain a version which is guaranteed to be current and
    -- thus have fast element access by @a '//' []@.

    -- Possible improvement for the future (not implemented now):
    -- make it possible to say "I will make an update now, but when
    -- I later return to the old version, I want it to mutate back
    -- instead of being copied".

-- Class of immutable arrays

{- | Class of immutable array types.

An array type has the form @(a i e)@ where @a@ is the array type
constructor (kind @* -> * -> *@), @i@ is the index type (a member of
the class 'Ix'), and @e@ is the element type.  The @IArray@ class is
parameterised over both @a@ and @e@, so that instances specialised to
certain element types can be defined.

{-# INLINE array #-} 

{-| Constructs an immutable array from a pair of bounds and a list of
initial associations.

The bounds are specified as a pair of the lowest and highest bounds in
the array respectively.  For example, a one-origin vector of length 10
has bounds (1,10), and a one-origin 10 by 10 matrix has bounds
((1,1),(10,10)).

An association is a pair of the form @(i,x)@, which defines the value of
the array at index @i@ to be @x@.  The array is undefined if any index
in the list is out of bounds.  If any two associations in the list have
the same index, the value at that index is implementation-dependent.
(In GHC, the last value specified for that index is used.
Other implementations will also do this for unboxed arrays, but Haskell
98 requires that for 'Array' the value at such indices is bottom.)

Because the indices must be checked for these errors, 'array' is
strict in the bounds argument and in the indices of the association
list.  Whether @array@ is strict or non-strict in the elements depends
on the array type: 'Data.Array.Array' is a non-strict array type, but
all of the 'Data.Array.Unboxed.UArray' arrays are strict.  Thus in a
non-strict array, recurrences such as the following are possible:

> a = array (1,100) ((1,1) : [(i, i * a!(i-1)) | i \<- [2..100]])

Not every index within the bounds of the array need appear in the
association list, but the values associated with indices that do not
appear will be undefined.

If, in any dimension, the lower bound is greater than the upper bound,
then the array is legal, but empty. Indexing an empty array always
gives an array-bounds error, but 'bounds' still yields the bounds with
which the array was constructed.

-- Then we could call listUArray at any type 'e' that had a suitable
-- MArray instance.  But sadly we can't, because we don't have quantified 
-- constraints.  Hence the mass of rules below.

-- I would like also to write a rule for listUArrayST (or listArray or
-- whatever) applied to unpackCString#. Unfortunately unpackCString#

{-# INLINE accumArray #-}

{-| 
Constructs an immutable array from a list of associations.  Unlike
'array', the same index is allowed to occur multiple times in the list
of associations; an /accumulating function/ is used to combine the
values of elements with the same index.

For example, given a list of values of some index type, hist produces
a histogram of the number of occurrences of each index within a
specified range:

> hist :: (Ix a, Num b) => (a,a) -> [a] -> Array a b
> hist bnds is = accumArray (+) 0 bnds [(i, 1) | i\<-is, inRange bnds i]

	=> (e -> e' -> e) 	-- ^ An accumulating function
	-> e			-- ^ A default element
	-> (i,i)		-- ^ The bounds of the array
	-> [(i, e')]		-- ^ List of associations
	-> a i e		-- ^ Returns: the array
accumArray f init (l,u) ies =
    unsafeAccumArray f init (l,u) [(index (l,u) i, e) | (i, e) <- ies]

{-# INLINE (//) #-}
{-|
Takes an array and a list of pairs and returns an array identical to
the left argument except that it has been updated by the associations
in the right argument.  For example, if m is a 1-origin, n by n matrix,
then @m\/\/[((i,i), 0) | i \<- [1..n]]@ is the same matrix, except with
the diagonal zeroed.

As with the 'array' function, if any two associations in the list have
the same index, the value at that index is implementation-dependent.
(In GHC, the last value specified for that index is used.
Other implementations will also do this for unboxed arrays, but Haskell
98 requires that for 'Array' the value at such indices is bottom.)

For most array types, this operation is O(/n/) where /n/ is the size
of the array.  However, the 'Data.Array.Diff.DiffArray' type provides
this operation with complexity linear in the number of updates.

An array type has the form @(a i e)@ where @a@ is the array type

the class 'Ix'), and @e@ is the element type.

The @MArray@ class is parameterised over both @a@ and @e@ (so that
instances specialised to certain element types can be defined, in the
same way as for 'IArray'), and also over the type of the monad, @m@,
in which the mutable array will be manipulated.

   Converts an mutable array into an immutable array.  The 
   implementation may either simply cast the array from
   one type to the other without copying the array, or it
   may take a full copy of the array.

   Note that because the array is possibly not copied, any subsequent
   modifications made to the mutable version of the array may be
   shared with the immutable version.  It is safe to use, therefore, if
   the mutable version is never modified after the freeze operation.

   The non-copying implementation is supported between certain pairs
   of array types only; one constraint is that the array types must
   have identical representations.  In GHC, The following pairs of
   array types have a non-copying O(1) implementation of
   'unsafeFreeze'.  Because the optimised versions are enabled by
   specialisations, you will need to compile with optimisation (-O) to
   get them.

-- character @%@, followed by one or more of the following flags:

--
-- followed optionally by a precision:

-- >    .num   precision (number of decimal places)

Version 3.0     28 May 1997
  * Cured massive performance bug.  If you write

        foldl <> empty (map (text.show) [1..10000])

    you get quadratic behaviour with V2.0.  Why?  For just the same
    reason as you get quadratic behaviour with left-associated (++)
    chains.

    This is really bad news.  One thing a pretty-printer abstraction
    should certainly guarantee is insensivity to associativity.  It
    matters: suddenly GHC's compilation times went up by a factor of
    100 when I switched to the new pretty printer.

    I fixed it with a bit of a hack (because I wanted to get GHC back
    on the road).  I added two new constructors to the Doc type, Above
    and Beside:

         <> = Beside
         $$ = Above

    Then, where I need to get to a "TextBeside" or "NilAbove" form I
    "force" the Doc to squeeze out these suspended calls to Beside and
    Above; but in so doing I re-associate. It's quite simple, but I'm
    not satisfied that I've done the best possible job.  I'll send you
    the code if you are interested.

  * Added new exports:
        punctuate, hang
        int, integer, float, double, rational,
        lparen, rparen, lbrack, rbrack, lbrace, rbrace,

  * fullRender's type signature has changed.  Rather than producing a
    string it now takes an extra couple of arguments that tells it how
    to glue fragments of output together:

        fullRender :: Mode
                   -> Int                       -- Line length
                   -> Float                     -- Ribbons per line
                   -> (TextDetails -> a -> a)   -- What to do with text
                   -> a                         -- What to do at the end
                   -> Doc
                   -> a                         -- Result

    The "fragments" are encapsulated in the TextDetails data type:

        data TextDetails = Chr  Char
                         | Str  String
                         | PStr FAST_STRING

    The Chr and Str constructors are obvious enough.  The PStr
    constructor has a packed string (FAST_STRING) inside it.  It's
    generated by using the new "ptext" export.

    An advantage of this new setup is that you can get the renderer to
    do output directly (by passing in a function of type (TextDetails
    -> IO () -> IO ()), rather than producing a string that you then
    print.


Version 2.0     24 April 1997
  * Made empty into a left unit for <> as well as a right unit;
    it is also now true that
        nest k empty = empty
    which wasn't true before.

  * Fixed an obscure bug in sep that occassionally gave very weird behaviour

  * Added $+$

  * Corrected and tidied up the laws and invariants

======================================================================
Relative to John's original paper, there are the following new features:

1.  There's an empty document, "empty".  It's a left and right unit for 
    both <> and $$, and anywhere in the argument list for
    sep, hcat, hsep, vcat, fcat etc.

    It is Really Useful in practice.

2.  There is a paragraph-fill combinator, fsep, that's much like sep,
    only it keeps fitting things on one line until it can't fit any more.

3.  Some random useful extra combinators are provided.  
        <+> puts its arguments beside each other with a space between them,
            unless either argument is empty in which case it returns the other


        hcat is a list version of <>
        hsep is a list version of <+>
        vcat is a list version of $$

        sep (separate) is either like hsep or like vcat, depending on what fits

        cat  behaves like sep,  but it uses <> for horizontal conposition
        fcat behaves like fsep, but it uses <> for horizontal conposition

        These new ones do the obvious things:
                char, semi, comma, colon, space,
                parens, brackets, braces, 
                quotes, doubleQuotes

4.  The "above" combinator, $$, now overlaps its two arguments if the
    last line of the top argument stops before the first line of the
    second begins.

        For example:  text "hi" $$ nest 5 (text "there")
        lays out as
                        hi   there
        rather than
                        hi
                             there

        There are two places this is really useful

        a) When making labelled blocks, like this:
                Left ->   code for left
                Right ->  code for right
                LongLongLongLabel ->
                          code for longlonglonglabel
           The block is on the same line as the label if the label is
           short, but on the next line otherwise.

        b) When laying out lists like this:
                [ first
                , second
                , third
                ]
           which some people like.  But if the list fits on one line
           you want [first, second, third].  You can't do this with
           John's original combinators, but it's quite easy with the
           new $$.

        The combinator $+$ gives the original "never-overlap" behaviour.

5.      Several different renderers are provided:
                * a standard one
                * one that uses cut-marks to avoid deeply-nested documents 
                        simply piling up in the right-hand margin
                * one that ignores indentation (fewer chars output; good for machines)
                * one that ignores indentation and newlines (ditto, only more so)

6.      Numerous implementation tidy-ups
        Use of unboxed data types to speed up the implementation

Laws for $$
~~~~~~~~~~~

<a2>    empty $$ x      = x
<a3>    x $$ empty      = x

        ...ditto $+$...

Laws for <>
~~~~~~~~~~~
<b1>    (x <> y) <> z   = x <> (y <> z)
<b2>    empty <> x      = empty
<b3>    x <> empty      = x

        ...ditto <+>...

Laws for text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<t1>    text s <> text t        = text (s++t)
<t2>    text "" <> x            = x, if x non-empty

Laws for nest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<n1>    nest 0 x                = x
<n2>    nest k (nest k' x)      = nest (k+k') x
<n3>    nest k (x <> y)         = nest k z <> nest k y
<n4>    nest k (x $$ y)         = nest k x $$ nest k y
<n5>    nest k empty            = empty
<n6>    x <> nest k y           = x <> y, if x non-empty

** Note the side condition on <n6>!  It is this that
** makes it OK for empty to be a left unit for <>.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<m1>    (text s <> x) $$ y = text s <> ((text "" <> x)) $$ 
                                         nest (-length s) y)

<m2>    (x $$ y) <> z = x $$ (y <> z)
        if y non-empty


Laws for list versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<l1>    sep (ps++[empty]++qs)   = sep (ps ++ qs)
        ...ditto hsep, hcat, vcat, fill...

<l2>    nest k (sep ps) = sep (map (nest k) ps)
        ...ditto hsep, hcat, vcat, fill...

Laws for oneLiner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<o1>    oneLiner (nest k p) = nest k (oneLiner p)
<o2>    oneLiner (x <> y)   = oneLiner x <> oneLiner y 

You might think that the following verion of <m1> would
be neater:

<3 NO>  (text s <> x) $$ y = text s <> ((empty <> x)) $$ 
                                         nest (-length s) y)

But it doesn't work, for if x=empty, we would have

        text s $$ y = text s <> (empty $$ nest (-length s) y)
                    = text s <> nest (-length s) y

  Here are the invariants:
  
  * The argument of NilAbove is never Empty. Therefore
    a NilAbove occupies at least two lines.
  
  * The arugment of @TextBeside@ is never @Nest@.
  
  
  * The layouts of the two arguments of @Union@ both flatten to the same 
    string.
  
  * The arguments of @Union@ are either @TextBeside@, or @NilAbove@.
  
  * The right argument of a union cannot be equivalent to the empty set
    (@NoDoc@).  If the left argument of a union is equivalent to the
    empty set (@NoDoc@), then the @NoDoc@ appears in the first line.
  
  * An empty document is always represented by @Empty@.  It can't be
    hidden inside a @Nest@, or a @Union@ of two @Empty@s.
  
  * The first line of every layout in the left argument of @Union@ is
    longer than the first line of any layout in the right argument.
    (1) ensures that the left argument has a first line.  In view of
    (3), this invariant means that the right argument must have at

{- Comments from Johannes Waldmann about what the problem might be:

   In the example above, d2 and d1 are deeply nested, but `text "+"' is not, 
   so the layout function tries to "out-dent" it.
   
   when I look at the Doc values that are generated, there are lots of
   Nest constructors with negative arguments.  see this sample output of
   d1 (obtained with hugs, :s -u)

-- QuickCheck properties that hold for the combinators

{- $properties
The following are QuickCheck specifications of what the combinators do.
These can be seen as formal specifications of the behavior of the
combinators.

We use bags to give semantics to the combinators.

>  type Bag a = [a]

Equality on bags does not care about the order of elements.

>  (=~) :: Ord a => Bag a -> Bag a -> Bool
>  xs =~ ys = sort xs == sort ys

A special equality operator to avoid unresolved overloading
when testing the properties.

>  (=~.) :: Bag (Int,String) -> Bag (Int,String) -> Bool
>  (=~.) = (=~)

Here follow the properties:

>  prop_Get_Nil =

-- This Haskell script defines a library of parser combinators, and is
-- taken from sections 1-6 of our article "Monadic Parser Combinators".
-- Some changes to the library have been made in the move from Gofer
-- to Haskell:
-- 
--    * Do notation is used in place of monad comprehension notation;
-- 
--    * The parser datatype is defined using "newtype", to avoid the overhead
--      of tagging and untagging parsers with the P constructor.

Basic assumptions
-----------------
Obviously we assume that there is a configure script, and that after the
ConfigCmd has been run, there is a Makefile.

ConfigCmd:     We assume the configure script accepts:
		--with-hc
		--with-hc-pkg
		--prefix
		--bindir
		--libdir
		--libexecdir
		--datadir

BuildCmd:      We assume the default Makefile target will build everything

InstallCmd:    We assume there is an install target
               Note that we assume that this does *not* register the package!

CopyCmd:       We assume there is a copy target, and a variable $(destdir)
		The 'copy' target should probably just invoke make install recursively, eg.
			copy :
				$(MAKE) install prefix=$(destdir)/$(prefix) \
						bindir=$(destdir)/$(bindir) \
						...
		The reason we can't invoke make install directly here is that we don't
		know the value of $(prefix).

SDistCmd:      We assume there is an dist target

RegisterCmd:   We assume there is a register target and a variable $(user)

UnregisterCmd: We assume there is an unregister target

HaddockCmd:    We assume there is a "docs" or "doc" target

ProgramaticaCmd: We assume there is a "programatica" target

-- Module      :  Distribution.Simple
-- Copyright   :  Isaac Jones 2003-2005
-- 
-- Maintainer  :  Isaac Jones <ijones@syntaxpolice.org>
-- Stability   :  alpha
-- Portability :  portable
--
-- Explanation: Simple build system; basically the interface for
-- Distribution.Simple.\* modules.  When given the parsed command-line
-- args and package information, is able to perform basic commands
-- like configure, build, install, register, etc.
--
-- This module isn't called \"Simple\" because it's simple.  Far from
-- it.  It's called \"Simple\" because it does complicated things to
-- simple software.

{-
Sven Panne <Sven.Panne@informatik.uni-muenchen.de> Oct. 1996 (small
changes Dec. 1997)

Two rather obscure features are missing: The Bash 2.0 non-option hack
(if you don't already know it, you probably don't want to hear about
it...) and the recognition of long options with a single dash
(e.g. '-help' is recognised as '--help', as long as there is no short
option 'h').

Other differences between GNU's getopt and this implementation:

* To enforce a coherent description of options and arguments, there
  are explanation fields in the option/argument descriptor.

* Error messages are now more informative, but no longer POSIX
  compliant... :-(

And a final Haskell advertisement: The GNU C implementation uses well
over 1100 lines, we need only 195 here, including a 46 line example! 
:-)

-- | Provides a platform-specific character used to separate directory levels in

-- This implements Concurrent Haskell's "MVar"s as described in the paper

--
-- except that we have made the following name changes for compatability
-- with GHC 2.05.
--
--   newMVar  -> newEmptyMVar
--
-- There is one significant difference between this implementation and
-- GHC 2.05: 
--
-- o GHC uses preemptive multitasking.
-- 
--   Context switches can occur at any time (except if you call a C
--   function (like "getchar") which blocks the entire process while
--   waiting for input.
-- 
-- o Hugs uses cooperative multitasking.  
-- 
--   Context switches only occur when you use one of the primitives
--   defined in this module.  This means that programs such as:
-- 
--     main = forkIO (write 'a') >> write 'b'
-- 	where
-- 	 write c = putChar c >> write c
-- 
--   will print either "aaaaaaaaaaaaaa..." or "bbbbbbbbbbbb..."
--   instead of some random interleaving of 'a's and 'b's.
-- 
-- Cooperative multitasking is sufficient for writing coroutines and simple
-- graphical user interfaces but the usual assumptions of fairness don't
-- apply and Channel.getChanContents cannot be implemented.

{- 
 Low-level op. for checking whether an MVar is filled-in or not.
 Notice that the boolean value returned  is just a snapshot of
 the state of the MVar. By the time you get to react on its result,
 the MVar may have been filled (or emptied) - so be extremely
 careful when using this operation.  

 Use tryTakeMVar instead if possible.

 If you can re-work your abstractions to avoid having to
 depend on isEmptyMVar, then you're encouraged to do so,
 i.e., consider yourself warned about the imprecision in
 general of isEmptyMVar :-)

-- A first cut at implementing the (key,value) form of Weak pointers.
--
-- Notes (please refer to the draft specification for background):
--
--  - Programmers using weak pointers should call runFinalizer at
--    regular intervals to ensure that finalizers are scheduled for
--    execution.  This implementation provides functions runFinalizer,
--    finalizerWaiting, and runAllFinalizers to provide programmers with
--    control over the execution of finalizers.  None of these functions
--    are part of the current specification.
--
-- Tested with Hugs 98.

-- Primitives for accessing Hugs internals.
--
-- NB These primitives are an _experimental_ feature which may be
--    removed in future versions of Hugs.
--    They can only be used if hugs was configured with the
--    "--enable-internal-prims" flag.
--
-- The primitives defined in this module provide the means with
-- which to implement simple error-recovery and debugging facilities
-- in Haskell.  
--
-- The error catching primitive only works if the "failOnError" flag 
-- is FALSE - ie Hugs was invoked with the "-f" flag.
--
-- Despite appearances, these primitives are referentially transparent
-- (with the exception of the rarely used pointer equality operations)
-- (The proof is really neat - but there just isn't enough space in the margin)
